                    <p>Suffice to say the video game industry is large, worth more than the film and music industries combined. Revenue is projected to break $400 billion next year. For comparison, according to market data by Statista, the film industry hit $81 billion in 2021.</p>
                    <p>The way video games make money has become a more recent discussion. Most console or computer games make money just from people buying the game. An increasing number of games, especially mobile games, are adopting a "freemium" revenue model, where the game itself is available for free, but more content, such as new costumes or characters, is behind paywalls. The strategies a game uses to make money is also known as how it monetizes, or its "monetization strategy.</p>
                    <p>In many cases, a freemium model includes 'microtransactions', which are smaller, incremental purchases made within the game. This can look like spending $0.99 for an extra life or $4.99 for a stash of in-game currency. Most games that employ a freemium model also use multiple monetization strategies. One such strategy is called a "loot box", an in-game box that can be purchased either for real world money or in-game currency and includes a randomized item or set of items. Sometimes, these items have in-game benefits, such as new characters or weapons, or they can be cosmetic, such as new character outfits or emotes. </p>
                    <p>Every video game is different, which means the game's loot box mechanics can come in many different forms. In Entertainment Arts' 'Star Wars: Battlefront II', there were four types of loot boxes that contained different kinds of rewards.</p>
                    <p>Three types could be purchase using an in-game currency known as credits, earned by playing the game or from the daily free loot box. Credits could also be purchased by crystals, another in-game currency that could be purchased by real world money.</p>
                    <p>In 2018, a groundbreaking research paper was published, showing a psychological link between <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0206767">spending on loot boxes and problem gambling</a>. This drew even more attention to &lsquo;Star Wars: Battlefront II', as many players considered the loot box mechanic unbalanced, calling the game's system "pay-to-win" or "unfair."</p>
                    <p>This outrage and new research evidence drew regulatory attention to video game monetization. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) introduced legislation that would have banned loot boxes and other "pay-to-win microtransactions" in games targeted towards children. Similar laws were introduced at the state level in Hawaii and Washington. Even though none of this legislation advanced, conversations about how to regulate loot boxes continues. The Federal Trade Commission hosted a public workshop in August 2019 to examine loot boxes through a consumer protection lens, and in the 2020 staff report, the FTC said it would continue monitoring this topic.</p>
                    <p>The FTC has indeed covered ground on digital consumer protections, hosting a workshop in 2021 and publishing a 48-page staff report on digital dark patterns. The report defines "digital dark patterns" as online design practices that may confuse or manipulate consumers into giving businesses their money or data.</p>
                    <p>On these grounds, the FTC alleged that Epic Games, creators of the popular video game 'Fortnite', violated consumer protection and children's privacy laws. The FTC reached a settlement with Epic Games on December 19, 2022, for $275 million.</p>
                    <p>These actions by the FTC are the most concrete legal precedent set in the US for video game monetization consumer protections. Most existing regulation comes not from player concerns, but parents. The US' foremost video game regulatory board is the Entertainment Software Rating Board, or ESRB, who provide video game ratings for parents.</p>
                    <p>Beyond the US, other nations and regulatory bodies have been examining video game monetization and applying laws ranging from disclosures to outright bans. For years, China has required games with loot boxes disclose the probabilities of items within those boxes. In Belgium, loot boxes were ruled illegal under the nation's existing gambling laws. The United Kingdom recently decided not to legislate loot boxes under the nation's gambling laws, but has called for more research and industry-self regulation.</p>
                    <p>It is unclear, in all the conversation about loot boxes, how actual video game players feel. And through this unpacking of video game monetization, it's clear that loot boxes are not the only monetization tactic to be worried about.</p>

                    <p>In the 1990â€™s, most were concerned about the content within video games, not how games made money. This was mostly because all the games at the time were either single-purchase cartridges for at home consoles or at an arcade. A handful of games, including Midway Manufacturingâ€™s 1992 â€˜Mortal Kombatâ€™, sparked the ire of parents worried that their children were being shown violent or sexual content through video games. This anger climbed its way to the Senate Governmental Affairs and Judiciary Subcommittees, chaired by Senators Herbert Kohl and Joe Liebermann, who held a series of hearings in 1993 and 1994 to address violence in video games.</p>
                    <p>The Entertainment Software Rating Board was formed from those hearings. Better known as the ESRB, the board has given ratings for video games available on consoles or PC (computer) since 1994.</p>
